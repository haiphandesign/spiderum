### Thơm is a renowned indie music festival started out as an university music night at RMIT University spreading out to the whole country with 4 events in diffenrent places around Vietnam. I had the opportunity to art directing Thơm Phết, its third installment.

I was brought in to create the key visual, the main poster and the ticket for the main event of the music festival. The read "Thơm" has been a stable mark of the franchise since its first stage back in 2017, I have the option to create a new one but decided to embrace the heritage. The decision was made to keep the original logo and just tweak it to fit the theme that I intended to go with which was to capturing the breath of a bygone "Bao cấp" period of time in the history of Vietnam in the 70s.

The ticket design created so that after the ticket stub is removed, the main part of the ticket can still be viewed as a mini poster. I want this to be something like a little collectible piece that audience can collect through many other King Park Media's events in the future.

The design was then got adapted to many other promotional materials, banners, backdrops and welcome gate at the main event.
